Many image based widgets do not perform well when the screen is resized. This
is due to the fact that the image must be relocated and expanded, sometimes in
multiple directions at once. You can significantly improve the user experience
by using the following tips:

1) Limit how the widgets move within the application window as the screen is
    resized. You can do this by anchoring widget groups within containers. So
    that they are not re-centering or repositioning as the screen size grows.

2) Limit the expansion of the widget to a single dimension (horizontal or
    vertical).

3) Give the widget a size.
